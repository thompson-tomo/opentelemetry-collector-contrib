display_name: Isolation Forest Processor
type: isolationforest

description: |
  The **Isolation Forest processor** adds inline, unsupervised anomaly detection to any OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline
  (traces, metrics, or logs). It embeds a lightweight implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm that automatically
  learns normal behaviour from recent telemetry and tags, scores, or optionally drops anomalies *in‑flight* – no
  external ML service required.
